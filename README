Walbottle
=========

Walbottle is a project for generating JSON unit test vectors from JSON Schemas.
It provides a library, libwalbottle, which implements JSON Schema parsing and
test vector generation.

See the test programs in libwalbottle/tests/ for simple examples of how to use
the code.

libwalbottle’s API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.
